description: Technical specification for the AI content generation pipeline, including context injection, template matching, and generation queues.

# ai-generation-pipeline

The AI generation pipeline consists of several coordinated services that handle workspace content generation:

## Generation Service (services/GenerationService.ts)
Importance Score: 90/100

Core generation workflow:
- Node content generation with domain context injection
- Multi-step validation of AI responses
- Fallback generation using template matching
- Context-aware prompt construction
- Response parsing into workspace structures

## Context Injector (services/ContextInjector.ts) 
Importance Score: 85/100

Context management system:
- Workspace structure analysis
- Template mapping based on node types
- Dynamic prompt construction
- Project characteristics extraction
- Technology stack detection

## Template Matching (services/PRDRetrievalService.ts)
Importance Score: 80/100

Template selection engine:
- Multi-criteria template ranking
- Domain-specific similarity scoring
- Template recommendation system
- Cache management for frequent patterns
- Weighted matching algorithm

## Generation Queue (services/GenerationQueue.ts)
Importance Score: 75/100

Queue management system:
- Priority-based request processing
- Domain-aware batching
- State tracking for long-running generations
- Failure handling with custom retry logic
- Request deduplication

## Generation Models
- GenerationRequest: Defines structure for generation jobs
- GenerationHistory: Tracks generation attempts and results
- PRDTemplate: Template definitions with metadata
- WorkspaceVersion: Version tracking for generations

Key Business Rules:
1. Generated content must maintain workspace consistency
2. Templates must match node domain types
3. Context injection requires valid parent relationships
4. Generation requests honor node type constraints
5. Queue priorities reflect business domain importance

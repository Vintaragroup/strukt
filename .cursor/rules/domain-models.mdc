Core Domain Models:

1. Node Classification Model [Importance: 90/100]
- Primary node types: root, frontend, backend, requirement, documentation
- Domain categories: Business, Product, Tech, DataAI, Operations
- Validation rules enforcing single root node per workspace
- Hierarchical positioning constraints based on node type
File: client/src/types/index.ts

2. Relationship System [Importance: 95/100]
- Relationship types: satisfies, depends_on, informs, duplicates, blocks  
- Bidirectional relationship validation
- Cycle prevention rules for dependency relationships
- Cross-domain relationship constraints
Files: 
- client/src/utils/relationships.ts
- client/src/components/CustomEdge.tsx

3. Workspace Model [Importance: 85/100]
- Version tracking for node graphs
- Snapshot management with metadata
- Template system for workspace initialization
- Access control rules per workspace
Files:
- server/src/models/Workspace.ts
- server/src/models/WorkspaceVersion.ts

4. Template System [Importance: 80/100]
- Domain-specific PRD templates by project type
- Template ranking based on relevance scoring
- Context-aware template matching
- Template versioning and inheritance rules
Files:
- server/src/models/PRDTemplate.ts
- server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts

5. Generation Model [Importance: 85/100]
- AI-driven content generation rules
- Domain-specific validation constraints
- History tracking of generated content
- Generation request workflow states
Files:
- server/src/models/GenerationRequest.ts
- server/src/models/GenerationHistory.ts

Key Validation Rules:
- Single root node per workspace
- No circular dependencies between nodes
- Required node type-specific fields
- Domain category restrictions
- Template inheritance constraints

The domain model implements a specialized visual requirements management system with strong emphasis on hierarchical relationships, version control, and AI-assisted content generation.

# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized visualization model for organizing and displaying nodes in concentric rings based on business domains:

## Core Ring Structure
[Importance Score: 95/100]

Located in: client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts
- Manages 5 primary business domain sectors:
  - Business
  - Product 
  - Tech
  - Data/AI
  - Operations
- Each sector occupies a fixed angular segment of the rings
- Dynamic ring scaling based on node density and importance
- Maintains hierarchical relationships through ring positioning

## Domain Node Placement
[Importance Score: 90/100]

Located in: client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx
- Custom sectoring algorithm determines optimal node placement
- Node importance influences radial distance from center
- Maintains parent-child relationships through ring proximity
- Handles collision detection between nodes in same sector
- Enforces domain-specific spacing rules between hierarchy levels

## Domain Relationships 
[Importance Score: 85/100]

Located in: client/src/utils/relationships.ts
- Specialized relationship types between domains:
  - depends-on: Technical dependencies
  - blocks: Business constraints
  - implements: Feature implementation
  - documents: Documentation links
  - tests: Test coverage
- Validates allowed relationships between different domain sectors
- Maintains domain hierarchy integrity during node connections

## Ring Analysis
[Importance Score: 80/100]

Located in: client/src/utils/analytics.ts
- Calculates domain-specific metrics:
  - Sector density analysis
  - Cross-domain connection patterns
  - Hierarchy depth measurements
  - Domain completeness scoring
- Generates insights on domain relationships and dependencies

## Hierarchy Management
[Importance Score: 75/100]

- Auto-adjusts ring radiuses based on hierarchy depth
- Maintains visual parent-child relationships
- Enforces domain-specific nesting rules
- Handles dynamic ring resizing during node additions/removals

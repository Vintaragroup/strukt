# graph-algorithms

Core graph algorithm implementations for domain-driven workspace organization:

1. Domain Layout Engine (domainLayout.ts)
- Radial sector allocation based on 5 business domains (Tech, Product, Business, Data/AI, Ops)
- Dynamic node positioning using polar coordinates within domain sectors
- Force-directed separation between nodes based on relationship types
- Hierarchical depth-based ring placement
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Relationship Manager (relationships.ts)
- Enforces DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure for requirement dependencies 
- Domain-aware validation of connections between different node types
- Critical path analysis for dependency chains
- Real-time cycle detection during edge creation
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Auto Layout System (autoLayout.ts)
- Domain-aware force simulation for optimal node distribution
- Hierarchical layering based on node relationships
- Cluster detection for related node groups
- Edge crossing minimization with domain context
Importance Score: 85/100

4. Edge Routing (edgeRouting.ts)
- Smart path finding between nodes respecting domain boundaries
- Obstacle avoidance for edge paths
- Bundle routing for parallel relationships
- Domain-aware control point placement
Importance Score: 80/100

5. Force Relaxation (d3Relax.ts)
- Custom force simulation for domain-specific spacing
- Attraction/repulsion based on node relationships
- Boundary constraints for domain sectors
- Stability detection for layout convergence
Importance Score: 75/100

The graph algorithms system implements specialized workspace organization focused on business domains, with strong emphasis on relationship validation and hierarchical structure maintenance. Core concepts include:

- Domain-driven node positioning
- Relationship type constraints
- Dependency validation
- Hierarchical layout
- Edge optimization

Core AI Generation Components:

1. Context Injection System (server/src/services/ContextInjector.ts)
Importance Score: 90
- Analyzes workspace state to build contextual prompts
- Extracts domain patterns from existing nodes and relationships
- Injects relevant PRD template sections based on node types
- Maintains context history for multi-turn generation

2. Generation Queue Management (server/src/services/GenerationQueue.ts)
Importance Score: 85
- Prioritized generation queue with domain-specific ordering
- Rate limiting with business context preservation
- Batching of related generation requests
- State management for partial completions

3. Template Matching System (server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts)
Importance Score: 85
- Domain-aware template selection algorithm
- Scoring based on:
  - Business domain alignment
  - Project context similarity
  - Node type compatibility
  - Historical success rates

4. Generation Pipeline (server/src/services/GenerationService.ts)
Importance Score: 90
- Multi-stage content generation workflow:
  1. Context building
  2. Template matching
  3. Content generation
  4. Post-processing
  5. Validation
- Domain-specific validation rules per node type

5. AI Provider Integration (server/src/services/ai/provider.ts)
Importance Score: 80
- Model selection based on content type
- Specialized prompt construction for:
  - Architecture suggestions
  - Relationship recommendations
  - Node content enrichment
  - Todo generation

Key Business Rules:
- Single root node enforcement
- Domain-specific relationship constraints
- Required metadata per node type
- Context preservation across generations
- Template versioning requirements

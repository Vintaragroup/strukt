# ai-generation-pipeline

Core generation pipeline components:

1. AI Content Generation Service (server/src/services/GenerationService.ts)
- Manages workspace architecture generation flows
- Domain-specific parsing of AI responses into node structures
- Template-based fallback generation for common architectures
- Custom validation rules for generated content
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Context Injection System (server/src/services/ContextInjector.ts)
- Builds specialized context objects for generation prompts
- Injects domain terminology and project-specific terms
- Maintains context hierarchy based on node relationships
- Template matching based on workspace characteristics
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Generation Queue Management (server/src/services/GenerationQueue.ts)
- Priority-based queue for generation requests
- Domain-specific rate limiting per request type
- Queue state persistence with recovery
- Request deduplication with context awareness
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Template Matching Algorithm (server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts)
- Semantic matching of workspace context to PRD templates
- Custom template ranking based on domain similarity
- Hybrid retrieval combining exact and fuzzy matching
- Domain-specific template filtering
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Generation Pipeline Flows:
1. Content Generation:
- Request validation
- Context building
- Template selection
- AI generation
- Response parsing
- Node structure creation

2. Template Processing:
- Context analysis
- Template matching
- Priority assignment
- Queue placement
- Generation scheduling

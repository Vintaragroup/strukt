# ai-generation-pipeline

Core AI Generation Pipeline Components:

1. Context Injection System (server/src/services/ContextInjector.ts)
- Workspace context analysis and categorization
- Custom prompt assembly with domain-specific templates
- Intelligent token budget allocation based on request type
- Dynamic context pruning based on relevance scoring
Importance: 90/100

2. Generation Queue Management (server/src/services/GenerationQueue.ts)
- Priority-based request scheduling with domain weights
- Request batching by template type and context similarity
- Automated retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request correlation and dependency tracking
Importance: 85/100

3. Template Matching Engine (server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts) 
- Semantic template selection based on workspace content
- Multi-stage filtering with business domain awareness
- Weighted template scoring using domain heuristics
- Template fusion for complex generation requests
Importance: 80/100

4. Generation Service Orchestration (server/src/services/GenerationService.ts)
- Request validation and enrichment pipeline
- Custom fallback chains for generation failures
- Domain-specific output normalization rules
- Generation history tracking with metadata
Importance: 85/100

Key Business Rules:
- Template selection must consider workspace domain context
- Generation requests require minimum context quality scores
- Queue priority determined by request type and user role
- Generated content must maintain workspace consistency

Business-Critical Flows:
1. Context Assembly:
- Workspace analysis
- Domain detection
- Context scoring
- Template matching

2. Generation Pipeline:
- Request queuing
- Priority scheduling
- Content generation
- Output normalization

3. Quality Control:
- Context validation
- Output verification
- Consistency checking
- History tracking

# ai-generation-pipeline

The AI generation pipeline implements domain-specific content generation with contextual awareness and template management.

Key Components:

1. Generation Service (Importance: 95/100)
Located in: server/src/services/GenerationService.ts
- Manages AI content generation workflow with domain-specific prompt assembly
- Integrates workspace context and template matching for accurate generation
- Implements custom error recovery and result validation
- Handles specialized generation modes for different node types

2. Context Injection System (Importance: 90/100)
Located in: server/src/services/ContextInjector.ts
- Builds rich context from workspace state and node relationships
- Implements template-aware context assembly
- Manages domain-specific context rules for different generation scenarios
- Handles specialized context pruning and relevance scoring

3. Generation Queue Management (Importance: 85/100)
Located in: server/src/services/GenerationQueue.ts
- Implements priority-based generation scheduling
- Manages concurrent generation requests with workspace awareness
- Handles generation retries with exponential backoff
- Tracks generation history and maintains state consistency

4. PRD Template Matching (Importance: 80/100)
Located in: server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts
- Domain-specific template scoring and selection
- Implements contextual template matching based on node types
- Manages template versioning and compatibility
- Handles template enrichment and customization

Core Business Rules:
- Generation must maintain workspace consistency
- Templates must match node domain and type
- Context must include relevant ancestor/sibling nodes
- Generated content must pass domain-specific validation
- Queue priority based on node relationships and workspace state

The system implements a sophisticated pipeline that combines workspace context, template matching, and AI generation while maintaining strict domain rules and consistency requirements.

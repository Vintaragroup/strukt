# ai-generation-pipeline

The AI generation pipeline implements a multi-stage content enrichment and suggestion system:

1. Generation Service Architecture (server/src/services/GenerationService.ts)
- Domain-specific workspace generation using GPT models
- Custom validation rules for AI-generated components
- Business context extraction and injection
- Intelligent template matching for content domains
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Context Management System (server/src/services/ContextInjector.ts)
- Project context aggregation and processing
- Domain classification for content generation
- Custom context scoring and relevance detection
- Template selection based on workspace patterns
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Generation Queue (server/src/services/GenerationQueue.ts)
- Priority-based generation request handling
- Request batching and optimization
- Custom retry strategies for failed generations
- Request state management and persistence
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Template Processing Pipeline (server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts)
- Vector-based template matching system
- Domain-specific template ranking
- Contextual template adaptation
- Template caching and versioning
Importance Score: 75/100

5. AI Suggestion Engine (server/src/services/ai/suggestions.ts)
- Context-aware node suggestion generation
- Relationship inference between components
- Domain validation for generated content
- Smart template application rules
Importance Score: 85/100

Key Integration Points:
- Generation service coordinates with template system
- Context injector feeds into suggestion engine
- Queue system manages pipeline flow
- Template processor validates outputs

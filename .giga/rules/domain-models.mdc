# domain-models

Core Domain Models:

1. Node Types (Importance: 90)
- Root node: Single allowed per workspace, defines project scope
- Implementation nodes: Frontend, backend, infrastructure 
- Documentation nodes: Requirements, specifications, testing
- Support nodes: Tasks, blockers, dependencies
- Each type has strict validation rules for properties and relationships

2. Domain Categories (Importance: 85)
- Business: Strategic and process nodes
- Product: Feature and UX components 
- Technology: Implementation and architecture
- Data/AI: Analytics and ML components
- Operations: DevOps and infrastructure

3. Relationship Types (Importance: 90)
- depends_on: Hard dependency between nodes
- implements: Requirements implementation link
- blocks: Blocker relationship with priority
- informs: Soft dependency/information flow
- documents: Documentation relationship
- Strict validation prevents circular dependencies

4. Workspace Model (Importance: 85)
- Template-based initialization
- Version control with 50-state history
- Node placement rules using ring system
- Domain-based node clustering
- Change tracking at node/edge level

5. Template System (Importance: 80)
- Industry-specific starter templates
- Custom validation schemas per template
- Auto-generated relationship rules
- Domain-specific node suggestions
- Context-aware template matching

# domain-models

### Node Types
- Core domain entities representing different architectural components
- Strong validation rules ensure nodes maintain domain integrity
- Custom metadata fields for domain-specific attributes
- Strict type hierarchy with inheritance rules
- Domain-specific validation per node type

File: `server/src/models/Workspace.ts`
Importance: 95

### Relationships
- Strictly typed connections between domain nodes 
- Built-in cycle detection and validation
- Domain-specific relationship types (depends-on, implements, documents)
- Custom metadata for relationship context
- Bidirectional relationship validation

File: `server/src/models/WorkspaceVersion.ts`
Importance: 90

### Workspaces
- Container model for domain nodes and relationships
- Version control with immutable history
- Workspace-level validation rules
- Context tracking for workspace state
- Template application rules

File: `server/src/models/GenerationHistory.ts`
Importance: 85

### Templates
- Domain-specific templates for different node types
- Template inheritance and composition rules
- Validation rules for template compatibility
- Custom metadata for template context
- Template version control

File: `server/src/models/PRDTemplate.ts` 
Importance: 80

### Validation Rules
- Cross-entity validation between nodes
- Domain-specific rule sets per node type
- Relationship constraint validation
- Template compatibility checking
- Workspace state validation

File: `server/src/utils/validation.ts`
Importance: 85

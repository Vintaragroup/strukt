# domain-models

Core Domain Models:

1. Node Types
- Custom domain-driven node classification system
- Categories: Business, Product, Technical, Data/AI, Operations 
- Required attributes: type, domain, relationships, metadata
- Validation rules enforce domain-specific constraints
- File: `/server/src/models/Workspace.ts`
Importance: 90/100

2. Relationships Model
- Directed acyclic graph structure enforced between nodes
- Relationship types: depends_on, implements, documents, blocks, tests
- Cross-domain relationship validation rules
- Circular dependency prevention
- File: `/client/src/utils/relationships.ts`
Importance: 85/100

3. Workspace Model
- Multi-user collaborative workspace structure
- Version control with snapshot management
- Access control and sharing rules
- Workspace templates with predefined node structures
- File: `/server/src/models/WorkspaceVersion.ts`
Importance: 80/100

4. Template System
- Industry-specific project templates
- Domain-based component organization
- Pre-defined relationship patterns
- Node type distribution rules per domain
- File: `/server/src/models/PRDTemplate.ts`
Importance: 75/100

5. Domain Layout Model
- Radial sector allocation by domain type
- Ring-based hierarchy system
- Department sub-grouping within domains
- Node positioning constraints
- File: `/client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`
Importance: 85/100

Key Validations:
- Nodes must belong to valid domains
- Relationships cannot cross certain domain boundaries
- Templates must maintain domain balance
- Workspace versions track all model changes
- Node type consistency within domains

Domain Integration Points:
- Cross-domain relationship rules
- Template-based workspace generation
- Domain-specific node validation
- Multi-domain workspace organization
- Version control across all models

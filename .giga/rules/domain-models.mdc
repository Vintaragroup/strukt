# domain-models

## Core Node Types

### Business Domain Nodes
- Product requirements
- Architecture components 
- Technical specifications
- Domain documentation

### Validation Rules
- Nodes must have unique IDs within workspace
- Required fields: title, type, domain, created date
- Optional fields: description, tags, relationships
Importance Score: 85

## Relationships

### Connection Types
- depends-on: Directional dependency between nodes
- implements: Implementation relationship 
- documents: Documentation linkage
- tests: Test coverage relationship

### Rules
- No circular dependencies allowed
- Cross-domain relationships require explicit approval
- Max relationship depth of 5 levels
Importance Score: 90

## Workspaces

### Structure
- Root workspace contains multiple projects
- Projects contain domain-specific node graphs
- Templates define starter workspace structures

### Validation
- Single root node per workspace
- Max 1000 nodes per workspace
- Required metadata: name, created date, owner
Importance Score: 80

## Templates

### Types
- Architecture patterns
- System designs
- Documentation structures 
- Process workflows

### Components
- Predefined node sets
- Default relationships
- Validation rules
- Domain categorization
Importance Score: 75

## Version Control

### Snapshots
- Full workspace state capture
- Relationship preservation
- Metadata versioning

### Rules
- Max 100 versions per workspace
- Required commit message
- Automatic daily snapshots
Importance Score: 85

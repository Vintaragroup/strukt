## Core Node Types

1. Knowledge Base Nodes
- Template-based nodes with domain classification
- Pre-defined validation rules per domain type
- Relationships constrained by domain compatibility matrix
- Custom metadata fields for requirement tracing

2. Workspace Graph Nodes
- Root node enforced with single-instance validation
- Technical nodes: frontend, backend, data, operations  
- Documentation nodes with freshness tracking
- Relationship nodes with bi-directional validation

## Node Relationships

1. Dependency Management
- Acyclic graph validation for technical dependencies
- Custom relationship types: implements, documents, requires
- Domain-specific connection rules between node types
- Auto-validation of circular references

2. Version Control
- Snapshot-based version control for node graphs
- Delta compression for node content changes
- Branch management with merge validation
- Custom diffing logic for node metadata

## Template Models

1. PRD Templates
- Domain-aware template matching system
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity
- Custom scoring algorithm for template relevance
- Auto-categorization by technical domain

2. Documentation Templates  
- Domain-specific card types
- Dynamic template composition
- Validation rules for required sections
- Custom metadata enrichment

## Data Models

1. Workspace Model
```typescript
interface Workspace {
  nodes: Node[]
  edges: Edge[]
  domain: DomainType
  rootNode: string
  version: string
  metadata: WorkspaceMetadata
}
```

2. Node Model
```typescript
interface Node {
  id: string
  type: NodeType
  domain: DomainType
  content: string
  metadata: NodeMetadata
  relationships: Relationship[]
  validations: ValidationRule[]
}
```

## Validation Rules

1. Graph Structure
- Single root node enforcement
- Acyclic dependency validation  
- Domain compatibility checks
- Required relationship validation

2. Content Rules
- Required fields by node type
- Format validation by content type
- Documentation freshness rules
- Reference integrity checks

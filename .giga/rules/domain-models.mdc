# domain-models

Core Domain Model Components:

1. Node Type System (Importance: 95/100)
- Strict node type hierarchy with parent-child validation
- Core types: root, requirement, frontend, backend, documentation
- Type-specific relationship constraints and validation rules
- Domain context awareness for node positioning and connections

2. Domain Ring Structure (Importance: 90/100)
- Five primary domain rings: Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations
- Inter-domain relationship validation and constraints
- Domain-specific metadata and attributes
- Hierarchical organization within each domain ring

3. Workspace Model (Importance: 85/100)
- Single root node requirement per workspace
- Version history tracking with snapshot capabilities
- Workspace-level validation rules and constraints
- Template association and inheritance

4. Relationship Types (Importance: 80/100)
- Bidirectional relationship tracking
- Core types: implements, depends-on, documents, tests
- Domain-specific validation rules for relationship creation
- Circular dependency prevention

5. Template System (Importance: 75/100)
- Domain-categorized templates with metadata
- Template inheritance and composition rules
- Validation rules for template instantiation
- Context-aware template suggestions

Key Validation Rules:
- Root node must be a requirement type
- Relationships must respect domain ring hierarchy
- Cross-domain connections require explicit validation
- Template instantiation must preserve domain context
- Node type changes must validate existing relationships

File Paths:
/server/src/models/
- Workspace.ts
- WorkspaceVersion.ts
- PRDTemplate.ts
- GenerationRequest.ts

The domain model implements a specialized graph-based architecture mapping system with strict hierarchical rules and domain-specific constraints, focusing on maintaining architectural integrity across different technical domains.

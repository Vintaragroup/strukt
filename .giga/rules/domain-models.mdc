# domain-models

## Node Model

### Core Structure
- Unique identifier and version tracking
- Domain classification (Product, Tech, Business, Data/AI, Ops)
- Type categorization (doc, requirement, backend, frontend)
- Custom metadata fields for domain-specific attributes
- Importance Score: 90

### Validation Rules
- Prevents circular dependencies in node relationships
- Enforces domain-specific naming conventions
- Validates required fields based on node type
- Domain-aware type compatibility checks
- Importance Score: 85

## Workspace Model

### Organization
- Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
- Version control with immutable snapshots
- Access control and collaboration rules
- Domain separation with cross-domain relationship tracking
- Importance Score: 90

### Template Integration
- Domain-specific template recommendations
- Automated template matching based on workspace context
- Custom validation rules for template application
- Template inheritance and composition patterns
- Importance Score: 85

## Relationship Types

### Core Types
- depends-on: Tracks technical dependencies
- implements: Links requirements to implementations
- documents: Associates documentation with components
- tests: Connects test cases to features
- Importance Score: 85

### Validation Matrix
- Cross-domain relationship rules
- Type compatibility enforcement
- Circular dependency prevention
- Required relationship validations
- Importance Score: 80

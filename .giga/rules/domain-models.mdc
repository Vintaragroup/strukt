## Core Domain Models

### Workspace Model
**Importance Score: 95**
- Represents the root container for architecture designs
- Implements versioning system with snapshots and history tracking
- Supports collaborative editing with change conflict resolution
- Contains metadata about workspace type, domains and context
- File: `server/src/models/Workspace.ts`

### Node Types
**Importance Score: 90**
- Defines domain-specific node categories:
  - Technical (Frontend, Backend, Data, Infrastructure)
  - Business (Requirements, Use Cases, Workflows)
  - Product (Features, Epics, User Stories)
  - Operations (SLAs, Runbooks, Monitoring)
  - Documentation (Architecture, APIs, Testing)
- Implements validation rules for node relationships
- File: `server/src/models/WorkspaceVersion.ts`

### Relationship Types 
**Importance Score: 85**
- Manages semantic connections between nodes:
  - Dependencies (requires, extends, implements)
  - Flows (data flow, process flow)
  - Organization (groups, contains)
  - Documentation (describes, specifies)
- Enforces domain-specific validation rules
- File: `server/src/types/ai.ts`

### Generation History
**Importance Score: 80**
- Tracks AI generation attempts and outcomes
- Records feedback and improvements
- Maintains suggestion quality metrics
- Files: `server/src/models/GenerationHistory.ts`, `server/src/models/GenerationRequest.ts`

### Template Models
**Importance Score: 85** 
- PRD templates with domain-specific sections
- Architecture patterns and best practices
- Node type templates with default metadata
- Files: `server/src/models/PRDTemplate.ts`

### Feedback Collection
**Importance Score: 75**
- Captures user feedback on generated content
- Maps feedback to specific node/relationship types
- Aggregates feedback for model improvements
- File: `server/src/models/Feedback.ts`

### Audit Trail
**Importance Score: 70**
- Records workspace modifications
- Tracks template usage patterns
- Monitors generation metrics
- File: `server/src/models/AuditLog.ts`

### Workspace Suggestions
**Importance Score: 85**
- AI-driven suggestions for workspace improvements
- Contextual recommendations based on workspace type
- Template matching algorithms
- Files: `server/src/models/Suggestion.ts`, `server/src/models/WizardSession.ts`

The domain models form an interconnected system focused on architecture generation, with strong emphasis on versioning, relationships, and AI-driven improvements. The models support both technical and business aspects of software architecture while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

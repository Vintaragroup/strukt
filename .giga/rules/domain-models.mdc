# domain-models

## Core Node Model
- Type-specific node validation rules enforcing domain constraints
- Relationship mapping between node types (frontend, backend, requirements, etc.)
- Template application rules based on node domain and type
- Node lifecycle management with state transitions

## Workspace Model
- Multi-domain workspace support with ring-based organization
- Node/edge relationship validation specific to domain boundaries
- Version control with domain-aware diffing
- Snapshot management preserving domain context
- Template application at workspace level

## Template Models
- Domain-specific templates for different architecture types
- Business validation rules for template matching
- Template inheritance and override patterns
- Version control for template evolution

## Domain Ring Structure
- Concentric ring organization (Business, Product, Tech, Data-AI, Operations)
- Node positioning rules within domain rings
- Cross-domain relationship validation
- Domain boundary enforcement

## Validation Rules
- Node type compatibility matrix for relationships
- Domain-specific node content validation
- Template matching criteria by domain
- Workspace structure validation

## Key Relationships
- Node-to-node dependencies with domain context
- Template-to-node application rules
- Workspace version linkage
- Node domain membership validation

## State Management
- Node lifecycle states with domain context
- Workspace versioning with domain preservation
- Template evolution tracking
- Relationship state validation

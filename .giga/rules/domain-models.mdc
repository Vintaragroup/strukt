## Core Domain Models

### Node Classification System
- Strict hierarchical model with ring-based inheritance
- Node types mapped to 4 core domains: Infrastructure, Frontend, Backend, Data/AI
- Parent-child relationships enforced through ring level (parent.ring + 1)
- Domain-specific validation rules per node type
Importance Score: 90

### Workspace Model
File: server/src/models/Workspace.ts
- Multi-tenant workspace structure supporting concurrent node graphs
- Version control with snapshot preservation
- Custom edge validation ensuring acyclic relationships
- Domain-scoped permissions and access controls
Importance Score: 85

### PRD Template Model 
File: server/src/models/PRDTemplate.ts
- Structured template system with domain-specific sections
- Vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities
- Custom validation schemas enforcing domain rules
- Technology profile mapping and API guidance
Importance Score: 80

### Relationship Types
File: server/src/services/relationships.ts
- Complex relationship management with semantic types
- Bidirectional validation rules
- Cycle detection in dependencies
- Domain-aware relationship scoring
Importance Score: 85

### Foundation Nodes
File: server/src/config/foundationNodes.ts
- Predefined templates for core architectural components
- Domain-specific scaffolding rules
- Smart association logic between components
- Template inheritance system
Importance Score: 75

## Validation Rules

### Graph Structure Validation
- Enforces acyclic relationships between nodes
- Validates ring hierarchy compliance
- Ensures proper domain classification
- Checks relationship type compatibility
Importance Score: 80

### Template Validation
- Enforces required sections based on node type
- Validates technology profile compatibility
- Ensures proper inheritance of base templates
- Checks completeness of documentation
Importance Score: 75

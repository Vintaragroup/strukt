## Core Node Types
- Root: Required single entry point for each workspace
- Frontend: UI/UX components and client-side features  
- Backend: Server components and APIs
- Requirement: Business/technical requirements
- Documentation: Supporting documentation and rationales

## Domain Classification
- Business: Core business capabilities and processes
- Product: Features and user-facing functionality
- Tech: Technical implementation and architecture

- depends_on: Technical dependencies
- informs: Information flow between components
- duplicates: Identifies redundant elements
- blocks: Indicates blocking dependencies

## Workspace Model
- Single root node requirement
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure enforced
- Version control with history tracking
- Owner and role-based access control
- Real-time collaboration support

## Template System
- Industry-specific architecture patterns
- Categorized by domain: Web, Mobile, Backend, Fullstack, Data, AI
- Structured technical requirements

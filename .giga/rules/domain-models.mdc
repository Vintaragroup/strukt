# domain-models

Core Domain Models:

1. Node Model (85/100)
- Types: root, frontend, backend, requirement, documentation
- Attributes:
  - id: Unique identifier
  - type: Node classification
  - domain: business, product, tech, data-ai, operations
  - metadata: Custom domain-specific properties
  - relationships: Array of connected node references
- Validation:
  - Single root node per workspace
  - Required domain assignment
  - Cycle prevention in relationships
  - Domain-specific attribute validation

2. Workspace Model (80/100)
- Properties:
  - nodes: Collection of workspace nodes
  - edges: Node relationships/dependencies  
  - version: Current workspace version
  - history: Limited to 50 state changes
  - templates: Applied workspace templates
- Rules:
  - Enforces DAG structure
  - Validates node/edge consistency
  - Maintains version history
  - Domain ring enforcement

3. Template Model (75/100)
- Categories:
  - Backend API templates
  - Frontend application templates
  - SaaS product templates
  - Data pipeline templates
  - ML feature templates
- Components:
  - Base node structure
  - Predefined relationships
  - Domain assignments
  - Default metadata

4. Relationship Model (70/100)
Types:
- depends-on: Dependency relationship
- implements: Implementation connection
- documents: Documentation link
- extends: Inheritance/extension
- references: Loose coupling
Rules:
- Type-specific validation
- Cross-domain restrictions
- Cycle prevention
- Cardinality constraints

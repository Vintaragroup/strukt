# domain-models

Core Data Models:

1. Node Types
- Root nodes: Single allowed per workspace, defines project context
- Frontend nodes: UI/UX components and interactions
- Backend nodes: Services, APIs, data models
- Requirements nodes: Business rules and acceptance criteria
- Documentation nodes: Specifications and technical docs

2. Domain Organization
- Business domain: Strategic and process nodes
- Product domain: Features and user stories
- Technical domain: Architecture and implementation
- Data/AI domain: Analytics and ML components
- Operations domain: DevOps and infrastructure

3. Relationship Types
- depends-on: Technical dependencies
- implements: Feature implementation links
- documents: Documentation connections
- blocks: Blocker relationships
- tests: Test coverage mapping

4. Workspace Structure
- Single root node requirement
- Strict hierarchy enforcement
- No circular dependencies allowed
- Domain-based node grouping
- Version history tracking

5. Template Models
- Project type templates (SaaS, Mobile, API, etc)
- Domain-specific node suggestions
- Relationship recommendations
- Default validation rules

Validation Rules:
- Root node uniqueness per workspace
- Valid parent-child relationships
- Domain boundary constraints
- Required fields by node type
- Relationship type compatibility

Key Files:
- server/src/models/Workspace.ts
- server/src/models/PRDTemplate.ts
- server/src/utils/relationships.ts
- client/src/utils/validation.ts

description: Handles the core domain-based radial visualization and node organization system for mapping software architectures

# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized radial layout engine for organizing software architecture components into distinct business domains. Core components include:

## Ring Layout Engine (85/100)
`client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`
- Calculates optimal ring positions using normalized sector angles
- Manages 5 core domains: Business, Product, Technology, Data/AI, Operations
- Dynamically adjusts ring radii based on node density and hierarchy depth
- Implements snap-to-grid positioning within domain sectors
- Preserves parent-child relationships during node repositioning

## Domain Sector Management (80/100)
`client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
- Renders domain-specific sectors with visual separation
- Implements domain-based color coding and visual hierarchies
- Handles node containment rules within domain boundaries
- Manages domain transitions and node movement between sectors
- Enforces domain-specific node placement constraints

## Node Hierarchy Control (75/100)
`client/src/components/CenterNode.tsx`
- Maintains central root node as domain anchor point
- Controls hierarchical node relationships across domain rings
- Implements domain-aware node expansion/collapse logic
- Manages domain-specific node connection rules
- Enforces single-root architecture constraints

Key Business Rules:
- Nodes must belong to exactly one domain sector
- Domain hierarchy flows from center outward through rings
- Parent-child relationships cannot cross domain boundaries
- Each domain sector has specific allowed node types
- Ring positions reflect architectural hierarchy depth

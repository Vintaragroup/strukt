# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements specialized business logic for organizing and validating hierarchical node relationships across different technical domains.

## Core Domain Ring Components

### Ring Classification Engine
File: `client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
Importance Score: 95

- Enforces strict domain ring hierarchy:
  - Business (Ring 0)
  - Product (Ring 1) 
  - Technical (Ring 2)
  - Implementation (Ring 3)
  - Operations (Ring 4)

- Ring calculation rules:
  - Child nodes must be in ring (parent.ring + 1)
  - Nodes cannot skip rings in hierarchy
  - Cross-ring relationships require validation
  - Orphan nodes default to outer ring

### Domain Position Calculator
File: `client/src/utils/relationships.ts`
Importance Score: 85

- Angular sector allocation per domain
- Node positioning within sectors
- Collision detection and spacing
- Parent-child relationship visualization
- Ring radius calculations based on node density

### Classification Validator
File: `client/src/config/classifications.ts` 
Importance Score: 90

- Domain-specific validation rules:
  - Frontend components require UI parent
  - Database nodes must connect to service
  - API endpoints require service parent
  - Infrastructure spans multiple rings
  - Cross-domain relationships require approval

### Circuit Breaking Logic
File: `server/src/services/CircuitBreaker.ts`
Importance Score: 80

- Prevents invalid ring transitions
- Enforces maximum depth rules
- Handles circular dependencies
- Manages relationship constraints
- Validates domain boundaries

The domain ring system represents core business logic for maintaining architectural hierarchy and domain relationships in software systems. It enforces strict rules about component placement while allowing flexibility within defined constraints.

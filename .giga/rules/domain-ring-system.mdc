# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized visualization approach for organizing nodes in concentric rings based on business domains:

Core Ring Management (client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx):
- Divides workspace into 5 primary domain sectors: Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations 
- Calculates precise sector angles and ring radiuses based on node density
- Maintains hierarchical node positioning within domain rings
- Enforces domain-specific node placement rules and constraints
Importance Score: 95/100

Layout Engine (client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts):
- Handles dynamic radius calculations for optimal ring spacing
- Implements domain boundary detection and overlap prevention
- Manages smooth transitions during node repositioning
- Calculates optimal node distribution within sectors
Importance Score: 90/100

Domain-Based Node Organization:
- Nodes inherit properties and constraints based on their domain ring
- Inner rings contain higher-level concepts, outer rings contain implementation details
- Automatic node repositioning maintains domain hierarchy
- Cross-domain relationships visually indicate system dependencies
Importance Score: 85/100

Ring Hierarchy Rules:
- Business domain occupies innermost ring (strategic)
- Product domain occupies second ring (tactical)
- Tech domain spans middle rings (implementation)
- Data/AI and Operations domains occupy outer rings (support)
- Node importance decreases with ring distance from center
Importance Score: 80/100

The system enforces strict domain separation while allowing relationship visualization across rings, creating a natural hierarchy from strategic business concepts to technical implementation details.

# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized visualization and organization model for managing hierarchical node relationships across different business domains.

## Core Components

### Domain Ring Calculator (Importance Score: 95)
File: `client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
- Ring-based hierarchical organization system separating nodes into distinct business domains
- Dynamic sector calculation with animated gradient boundaries 
- Business domain classification:
  - Business Strategy & Goals
  - Product Management 
  - Technical Architecture
  - Data & AI Infrastructure
  - Operations & Infrastructure
- Sector size allocation based on node density and relationships

### Node Positioning Engine (Importance Score: 90)
File: `client/src/components/CenterNode.tsx`
- Specialized node visualization for multi-level concept hierarchies
- Gradient-based domain indicators showing node domain alignment
- Multi-directional connection routing with domain boundary awareness
- Dynamic expansion/collapse with size management for concept hierarchies

### Layout Recipe System (Importance Score: 85)
File: `client/src/config/layoutRecipes.ts`
- Domain-specific layout patterns for different business contexts
- Pre-configured arrangements for common architectures:
  - Authentication systems
  - Payment processing flows
  - Analytics pipelines
  - Data warehousing
- Business rule mappings between node types and recommended layouts

### Domain Relationship Manager (Importance Score: 80)
File: `client/src/components/CustomNode.tsx`
- Domain-aware node type system with specific behaviors
- Documentation accuracy scoring and staleness detection
- Domain-specific card template recommendations
- Hierarchical node grouping and relationship validation

### Domain Collision Detection (Importance Score: 75)
File: `client/src/utils/geometry.ts`
- Custom collision detection for nodes crossing domain boundaries
- Sector boundary calculations for node placement
- Domain overlap resolution with hierarchical priorities
- Ring radius optimization based on node density

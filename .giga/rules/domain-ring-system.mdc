# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized radial layout architecture for organizing workspace nodes into concentric rings based on their domain classification and relationships.

Core Components:

1. Ring Layout Engine
- Divides workspace into 5 primary domains: Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations
- Calculates sector angles based on node density and relationships
- Maintains proportional spacing between domain boundaries
- Implements force-directed node positioning within sectors
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Domain Classification System
- Auto-categorizes nodes into domains based on content and relationships
- Handles multi-domain node placement with weighted positioning
- Enforces domain-specific validation rules and constraints
- Manages domain boundary flexibility based on node density
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Ring Level Management
- Supports 6 concentric rings representing hierarchy levels
- Implements specialized ring promotion/demotion logic
- Calculates optimal ring radius based on node count
- Handles cross-ring relationship visualization
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Node Positioning Algorithm
- Places nodes using polar coordinates within domain sectors
- Implements collision avoidance between nodes in same ring
- Optimizes node spacing for relationship line clarity
- Maintains visual hierarchy through ring-based positioning
Importance Score: 75/100

Key File Paths:
```
client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx
client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts
client/src/utils/relationships.ts
```

The system uniquely combines domain-based organization with hierarchical ring structures to create an intuitive visual representation of workspace architecture while maintaining logical groupings and relationships between nodes.

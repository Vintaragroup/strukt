description: Documents domain-ring architecture system for organizing and visualizing nodes in concentric business domain rings
---


# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized radial layout for organizing nodes into business domain sectors:

Core Ring Management (client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts):
- Calculates sector angles for 5 primary business domains:
  - Business (0-72°)
  - Product (72-144°)
  - Tech (144-216°)
  - Data/AI (216-288°)
  - Operations (288-360°)
- Manages 6 concentric rings based on node hierarchy depth
- Dynamically adjusts ring radii based on viewport and node density
- Maintains domain-specific node placement with collision avoidance
Importance Score: 90

Domain Ring Visualization (client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx):
- Renders interactive domain sectors with visual indicators
- Handles domain-specific hover states and selection
- Manages visual feedback for node movements between domains
- Implements domain boundary snapping behavior
Importance Score: 85

Relationship Management (client/src/utils/relationships.ts):
- Enforces domain-specific relationship rules:
  - Business nodes can only connect to Product/Operations
  - Tech nodes require Product node dependencies
  - Data/AI nodes must connect through Tech domain
  - Operations nodes can connect across all domains
- Validates cross-domain relationships based on business context
Importance Score: 85

Edge Routing (client/src/components/CustomEdge.tsx):
- Routes connections between domains using specialized paths
- Adjusts edge curvature based on source/target domain positions
- Provides visual indicators for cross-domain relationships
- Handles domain boundary crossing animations
Importance Score: 75

The system creates a structured visual hierarchy representing business domains while enforcing valid relationships between components across different organizational areas.

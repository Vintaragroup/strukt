---


# domain-ring-system

### Core Domain Organization System
- Implements specialized radial layout algorithm for organizing nodes into domain sectors
- Dynamic sector size calculation based on node density and importance 
- Five primary domains: Product, Technology, Business, Data/AI, Operations
- Automatic node distribution within sectors based on relationships
Importance Score: 95

### Domain Ring Manager
`client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
- Controls domain ring visualization and interaction
- Handles sector boundary calculations and transitions
- Manages node placement within sectors using polar coordinates
- Implements collision detection between nodes in same sector
Importance Score: 90

### Layout Engine 
`client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`
- Calculates optimal node positions within domain sectors
- Implements force-directed layout within sector constraints
- Handles sector resize and reflow operations
- Maintains hierarchical relationships during layout
Importance Score: 85

### Key Features:
1. Sector Management
- Dynamic sector angle calculation based on domain importance
- Smart sector resizing based on node density
- Smooth transitions during sector changes
Importance Score: 80

2. Node Positioning
- Hierarchical node placement within sectors
- Distance-based positioning from sector center
- Smart overlap avoidance within sectors
Importance Score: 85

3. Domain Relationships
- Visual connection handling between domains
- Cross-domain relationship visualization
- Relationship strength indicators
Importance Score: 80

4. Hierarchy Management
- Parent-child relationship visualization
- Sub-domain organization within main domains
- Hierarchical collapse/expand functionality
Importance Score: 85

5. Domain-specific Rules
- Custom layout rules per domain type
- Domain-specific node spacing algorithms
- Visual differentiation between domains
Importance Score: 75

The domain ring system implements a unique approach to organizing and visualizing software architecture components using a radial layout with domain-specific sectors. Each sector represents a key business domain with its own layout rules and relationship handling.

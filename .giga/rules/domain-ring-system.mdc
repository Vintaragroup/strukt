description: Specialized visualization system for organizing and displaying nodes in domain-based concentric rings with sector divisions

# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements specialized radial visualization with business-domain based organization:

1. Core Ring Structure
- 5 primary domain sectors: Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations 
- Concentric rings representing hierarchy levels within each domain
- Angular sector calculations based on node density and importance
- Dynamic radius scaling based on depth and node count

2. Node Positioning Logic (Score: 85/100)
Path: client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx
- Custom sector-based node placement algorithm
- Maintains minimum angular separation between nodes
- Handles parent-child relationships across rings
- Implements domain boundary enforcement

3. Ring Layout Management (Score: 80/100)
Path: client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts
- Calculates optimal ring radii for hierarchy levels
- Manages domain sector boundaries and transitions
- Handles node overflow and ring expansion
- Dynamic resizing based on viewport constraints

4. Domain-Specific Behaviors
- Automatic node categorization into domain sectors
- Enforces domain-specific connection rules
- Maintains visual hierarchies within domains
- Handles cross-domain relationships

5. Visual Elements
- Animated gradient backgrounds per domain
- Sector boundary indicators
- Hierarchical connection lines
- Domain-specific styling and iconography

The system enforces strict domain separation while allowing controlled cross-domain relationships, creating a structured visualization that reflects organizational boundaries and hierarchies.

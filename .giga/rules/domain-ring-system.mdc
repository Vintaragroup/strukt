# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements specialized business logic for organizing and visualizing nodes in a radial layout with domain-specific sectors:

### Core Ring Layout Engine
- Calculates optimal ring positions based on node hierarchies and domain types
- Maps business domains to specific ring sectors (Tech, Product, Business, Data/AI, Operations) 
- Dynamically adjusts sector angles based on node density and importance
- Importance Score: 95

File: `client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`

### Domain-Specific Node Positioning
- Places nodes within appropriate domain sectors based on type classification
- Implements smart spacing algorithms to prevent node overlap while maintaining domain grouping
- Handles node repositioning when domains are resized or reorganized
- Importance Score: 90

File: `client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`

### Sector Boundary Management
- Maintains dynamic boundaries between domain sectors
- Calculates sector angles based on weighted node distribution
- Enforces minimum sector sizes to ensure readability
- Importance Score: 85

### Ring Hierarchy Rules
- Inner rings contain higher-level architectural components
- Outer rings contain implementation details and supporting elements
- Automatic ring assignment based on node type and relationships
- Importance Score: 80

### Domain Classification System
- Categorizes nodes into domain types based on content and relationships
- Supports custom domain definitions for specialized projects
- Provides domain suggestion engine for new nodes
- Importance Score: 85

### Visual Domain Indicators
- Color coding for different domain sectors
- Dynamic sector labels that adjust with ring rotation
- Visual hierarchy indicators showing domain relationships
- Importance Score: 75

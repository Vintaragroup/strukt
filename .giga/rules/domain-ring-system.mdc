# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements specialized domain-based node organization using a radial layout approach:

### Core Domain Ring Logic
- Calculates sector angles based on domain importance and node density
- Assigns nodes to appropriate rings based on hierarchy level and domain type
- Manages domain-specific color schemes and visual indicators
- Handles collisions between nodes within and across rings
Importance Score: 95

Implementation in `client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`:
```typescript
interface DomainRing {
  radius: number
  sectors: DomainSector[]
  nodes: NodeData[]
}

// Custom domain sector calculation
calculateSectorAngles(domains: Domain[]): number[] {
  // Domain-specific angle allocation based on importance weights
  // Returns array of angles for each domain sector
}
```

### Domain Layout Engine
- Positions nodes using polar coordinates within their assigned sectors
- Maintains minimum spacing between related nodes
- Optimizes node distribution to minimize edge crossings
- Handles dynamic resizing of rings based on content
Importance Score: 85

Implementation in `client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`:
```typescript
class DomainLayoutEngine {
  assignNodesToDomains(nodes: Node[]): DomainAssignment
  calculateRingRadii(assignments: DomainAssignment): number[]
  optimizeNodePositions(rings: DomainRing[]): NodePosition[]
}
```

### Domain-Aware Node Management  
- Tracks node domain membership and relationships
- Handles domain transitions when nodes are moved
- Maintains parent-child relationships across domain boundaries
- Updates domain statistics and metrics
Importance Score: 80

Implementation in `client/src/components/CustomNode.tsx`:
```typescript
interface DomainNode {
  domain: string
  level: number
  parentDomain?: string
  childDomains: string[]
}
```

The domain ring system serves as the core organizational structure, implementing specialized business rules for:
- Domain hierarchy management
- Cross-domain relationships
- Visual domain separation
- Node positioning optimization
- Domain-based filtering and grouping

description: Technical specification for the domain-ring visualization system that organizes nodes into concentric rings based on business domains
---


# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements specialized visualization logic for organizing nodes into concentric rings based on their business domains. The system consists of several key components:

## Ring Calculation Engine
File: client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx
Importance Score: 95

Core logic for calculating and positioning domain-based rings:
- Domain Ring Structure:
  - Business (outermost)
  - Product
  - Technical
  - Data/AI  
  - Operations (innermost)
- Each ring subdivided into sectors based on node density
- Dynamic radius calculation based on node count per domain
- Automatic sector sizing with overlap prevention

## Node Positioning System
File: client/src/utils/geometry.ts
Importance Score: 90

Specialized node placement algorithms:
- Ring-specific node distribution with force-directed spacing
- Inter-ring relationship optimization 
- Node repositioning with domain transition handling
- Custom coordinate system for radial layout

## Domain Classification
File: client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts
Importance Score: 85

Business rules for domain assignment:
- Automatic domain detection based on node type and metadata
- Custom scoring system for domain affinity
- Multi-domain node handling with primary/secondary assignments
- Domain inheritance rules for connected nodes

## Visual Organization Rules
File: client/src/utils/nodePositioning.ts  
Importance Score: 80

Business-specific visualization constraints:
- Mandatory single root node in center
- Domain-based color coding system
- Relationship line routing between rings
- Visual emphasis rules based on node importance

The system enables intuitive organization of architectural components while enforcing business domain separation through physical positioning and visual hierarchies.

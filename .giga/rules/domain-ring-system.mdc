## Ring Layout Engine
- Implements specialized radial layout algorithm for organizing nodes by business domains
- Custom domain configurations for Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, and Operations rings
- Intelligent sector size calculations based on node density
- Node placement optimization within sectors using force-directed layouts
- Department-specific positioning with context-aware angle distribution
- Importance Score: 95

```typescript
// client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts
interface DomainRing {
  domain: string;
  radius: number;
  sectors: Sector[];
}

interface Sector {
  startAngle: number;
  endAngle: number;
  nodes: Node[];
}
```

## Domain-Specific Visualization
- Custom SVG path generation for sector visualization with dynamic gradients
- Intelligent node grouping within sectors based on relationships
- Visual hierarchy management through ring spacing and node placement
- Interactive sector resizing based on content density
- Importance Score: 90

```typescript
// client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx
const calculateSectorPath = (ring: DomainRing, sector: Sector): string => {
  // Domain-specific path calculation logic
}
```

## Node Alignment System
- Smart node alignment within sectors based on domain context
- Relationship-aware positioning to minimize edge crossings
- Department clustering with intelligent space distribution
- Dynamic sector boundaries based on content relationships
- Importance Score: 85

```typescript
// client/src/utils/alignment.ts
const alignNodesInSector = (nodes: Node[], sector: Sector) => {
  // Domain-aware node alignment logic
}
```

## Domain Ring Hierarchy
- Multi-level ring structure with inheritance relationships
- Dynamic ring scaling based on domain importance
- Intelligent ring spacing with relationship density consideration
- Automatic domain detection from node metadata
- Importance Score: 80

## Domain Context Management
- Context-aware sector generation based on project type
- Smart domain mapping for unassigned nodes
- Department-based node clustering within sectors
- Historical pattern analysis for optimal sector sizing
- Importance Score: 75

description: Specifications for domain-based radial node layout system with hierarchical ring positioning and sector management
---


# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements specialized node organization through concentric rings and sectors:

## Ring Structure
- Outer ring: Business domain nodes
- Middle ring: Product/feature nodes
- Inner ring: Technical implementation nodes
- Core ring: Root node
Importance Score: 90/100

File: client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts
- Calculates optimal sector angles based on node density
- Manages node distribution across rings
- Handles domain boundary calculations
- Implements hierarchical node positioning logic

## Domain Sectors
Five primary sectors with fixed angular positions:
1. Business (0-72°)
2. Product (72-144°) 
3. Technical (144-216°)
4. Data/AI (216-288°)
5. Operations (288-360°)
Importance Score: 85/100

## Node Positioning Rules
File: client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx
- Nodes inherit sector from parent domain
- Automatic radius calculation based on ring level
- Force-directed positioning within sectors
- Collision detection between adjacent nodes
Importance Score: 80/100

## Hierarchy Management
- Maximum 4 ring levels supported
- Parent-child relationships enforce ring constraints
- Nodes can only connect to adjacent rings
- Cross-sector relationships require special routing
Importance Score: 75/100

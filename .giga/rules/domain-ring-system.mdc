# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized visualization approach for organizing and displaying hierarchical domain relationships.

## Core Components

### Domain Ring Calculator
**Importance Score**: 90
- Calculates optimal sector angles for each domain category
- Implements dynamic resizing based on node density
- Maintains visual hierarchy through nested ring segments
- Handles collision detection between adjacent sectors

### Node Positioning Engine
**Importance Score**: 85
- Places nodes within appropriate ring sectors based on domain classification
- Implements radial distribution algorithm for even node spacing
- Maintains parent-child relationships through ring nesting
- Calculates optimal node distances based on hierarchy depth

### Hierarchy Manager 
**Importance Score**: 80
- Tracks domain relationships and inheritance
- Manages domain-specific node types and their valid positions
- Implements rules for allowed cross-domain relationships
- Handles domain boundary constraints and validation

### Ring Sector Logic
**Importance Score**: 75
- Divides ring space based on domain classification weights
- Implements dynamic sector expansion/contraction
- Manages sector highlighting and selection states
- Handles sector-based node grouping and ungrouping

The system uses a specialized ring-based visualization approach where:
- Outer rings represent high-level domains
- Inner rings show nested sub-domains
- Node placement reflects domain hierarchy
- Sector sizes adjust based on content
- Cross-domain relationships maintain visual clarity

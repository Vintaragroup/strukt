# domain-ring-system

The domain ring system implements a specialized radial visualization model for organizing nodes into concentric rings based on business domains:

Core Components:

1. Ring Layout Engine
Importance Score: 95/100
Location: client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx

- Concentric ring generation with dynamic radius calculations
- Sector-based node positioning using angular coordinates
- Domain boundaries with gradient transitions
- Interactive domain ring resizing and reordering
- Node clustering within domain sectors

2. Domain Layout Manager
Importance Score: 90/100
Location: client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts

- Domain classification system:
  - Business (outermost ring)
  - Product
  - Technology
  - Data/AI
  - Operations (innermost ring)
- Sector allocation algorithms for node distribution
- Cross-domain relationship routing
- Node positioning optimization within sectors

3. Node Positioning System
Importance Score: 85/100

- Dynamic sector sizing based on node density
- Radial force-directed layout within sectors
- Hierarchical node grouping by domain
- Collision detection and avoidance
- Edge crossing minimization between rings

Key Business Rules:
- Nodes must belong to exactly one domain ring
- Inner rings can only connect to adjacent outer rings
- Domain sectors maintain consistent angular spans
- Relationships cannot skip rings
- Node clusters remain within domain boundaries

The system enforces a strict hierarchical organization while enabling flexible node positioning and relationship visualization across different business domains.

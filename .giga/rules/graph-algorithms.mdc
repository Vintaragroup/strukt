# graph-algorithms

Domain Layout Engine
- Radial domain clustering algorithm that organizes nodes into concentric rings
- Each ring represents a business domain tier (Product, Tech, Operations, Data)
- Nodes within same domain automatically clustered with configurable gravity
- Force-directed repulsion between different domains
Importance Score: 90/100

Relationship Management
- Bidirectional edge routing with conflict resolution
- Cycle detection using modified depth-first traversal 
- Smart edge bundling for parallel relationships
- Domain boundary crossing minimization
Importance Score: 85/100

Graph Operations
- Domain-aware node positioning with semantic distances
- Hierarchical layout preservation during operations
- Smart node insertion maintaining existing relationships
- Automatic relationship suggestion based on domain rules
Importance Score: 80/100

Auto-Layout System
- Multi-stage layout pipeline:
  1. Domain clustering
  2. Hierarchical arrangement
  3. Edge crossing minimization
  4. Final force-directed relaxation
- Preserves mental map during incremental updates
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Patterns:
1. Domain-centric organization
2. Semantic relationship management
3. Layout stability preservation
4. Hierarchical clustering

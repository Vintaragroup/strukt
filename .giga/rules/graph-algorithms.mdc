### Core Domain Layout System
Importance Score: 90
File: `client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`

Specialized radial layout algorithm for organizing nodes into business domains:
- Dynamic ring radius calculation based on node density
- Domain-specific angle allocation for different business units
- Smart node distribution within domain sectors
- Collision detection and avoidance between nodes
- Domain boundary enforcement with padding

### Relationship Management 
Importance Score: 85
File: `client/src/utils/relationships.ts`

Custom graph traversal and validation system:
- Relationship type enforcement based on node domains
- Bi-directional relationship validation
- Cycle detection in dependency chains
- Critical path analysis for project dependencies
- Relationship suggestion engine using domain context

### Auto-Layout Engine
Importance Score: 80
File: `client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts`

Domain-aware force-directed layout algorithm:
- Node positioning based on relationship strength
- Domain boundary constraints
- Hierarchical layout within domains
- Edge crossing minimization
- Node cluster detection and spacing

### Edge Routing System
Importance Score: 75
File: `client/src/utils/edgeRouting.ts`

Smart edge routing algorithm for domain-based layouts:
- Domain-aware path finding
- Obstacle avoidance with domain rings
- Bundle edge routing for parallel relationships
- Smart anchor point selection based on node types
- Dynamic path recalculation on node movement

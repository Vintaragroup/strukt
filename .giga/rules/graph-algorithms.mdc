## Domain Ring Layout System
File: `client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
Importance Score: 95

Implements specialized ring-based layout system for software architecture visualization:
- Domain-driven concentric ring calculation based on node type
- Smart node placement within domain sectors (Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations)
- Radial force-directed layout with domain constraints
- Domain boundary enforcement during node movement
- Auto-spacing logic to prevent node overlap while maintaining domain integrity

## Edge Routing Engine
File: `client/src/utils/edgeRouting.ts`
Importance Score: 85

Custom edge routing system for architectural relationships:
- Domain-aware path finding that respects ring boundaries
- Smart bendpoint insertion based on source/target domain positions
- Specialized routing for cross-domain relationships
- Edge bundling for parallel connections between domains
- Collision avoidance with intermediate nodes

## Graph Operations
File: `client/src/utils/graphOps.ts`
Importance Score: 90

Domain-specific graph manipulation:
- Cycle detection specialized for architectural dependencies
- Node promotion/demotion between domain rings
- Domain integrity validation during node operations
- Relationship type enforcement based on domain rules
- Automated domain assignment based on node characteristics

## Auto Layout Engine
File: `client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts`
Importance Score: 85

Architecture-aware layout algorithms:
- Domain-specific force calculations
- Ring-based positioning constraints
- Smart initial placement based on node type
- Domain cluster detection and spacing
- Relationship-aware node positioning

The graph algorithms focus heavily on domain-driven layout and relationship management, with specialized handling of software architecture concepts like domain rings, component dependencies, and architectural boundaries.

# graph-algorithms

Core domain-specific graph algorithms:

1. Domain Ring Layout System (utils/domainLayout.ts)
Importance Score: 90
- Radial layout algorithm organizing nodes into business domain rings
- Sector allocation by domain: Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations 
- Smart angular distribution based on node density and relationships
- Collision avoidance with domain-aware spacing rules
- Hierarchical ring assignment based on node dependencies

2. Relationship Graph Management (utils/relationships.ts) 
Importance Score: 85
- Domain relationship validation enforcing business rules
- Circular dependency detection with severity classification
- Critical path analysis for dependency chains
- Relationship suggestion engine using node context
- Edge routing with domain boundary awareness

3. Auto-Layout Engine (utils/autoLayout.ts)
Importance Score: 80
- Force-directed layout with domain constraints
- Node clustering by business function
- Smart edge bundling for related domains
- Viewport optimization with domain preservation
- Layout persistence across sessions

4. Cycle Detection System (utils/graphOps.ts)
Importance Score: 75
- Business impact analysis for dependency cycles
- Domain-aware cycle breaking suggestions
- Relationship validation across domain boundaries
- Node hierarchy enforcement rules
- Cross-domain relationship optimization

The system implements specialized graph algorithms focused on business domain visualization and relationship management, with emphasis on maintaining logical groupings and hierarchies while ensuring optimal layout and readability.

# graph-algorithms

Core graph algorithm implementations for domain-specific visualization and relationship management:

1. Domain Ring Layout System (90/100)
- Specialized radial layout algorithm organizing nodes into 5 business domains
- Dynamic sector calculation based on domain hierarchies 
- Smart node positioning within domain rings using force-directed placement
- Automatic radius and angle calculations for optimal domain separation

2. Relationship Management Engine (85/100)
- Custom graph traversal for detecting circular dependencies
- Domain-aware edge routing with specialized rules per node type
- Relationship validation based on node domain and type
- Automatic relationship suggestion based on node proximity and type

3. Auto-Layout Algorithm (80/100)
- Force-directed layout optimized for domain boundaries
- Collision detection system respecting domain constraints
- Node clustering by relationship density
- Automatic spacing adjustments for readability

4. Edge Routing System (75/100) 
- Smart path calculation avoiding domain boundary crossings
- Specialized routing for inter-domain vs intra-domain connections
- Edge bundling for related connections
- Automatic bend point calculation based on connection type

5. Graph Analysis Engine (70/100)
- Domain hierarchy validation
- Path optimization between related nodes
- Connection pattern detection
- Relationship cycle identification

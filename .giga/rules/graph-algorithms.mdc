Core Graph Algorithm Components:

1. Domain Ring Layout System (client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts)
- Radial layout algorithm organizing nodes into business domain sectors
- Smart node positioning within domain rings based on relationships
- Dynamic sector sizing based on node density
- Cross-domain relationship optimization
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Edge Routing Engine (client/src/utils/edgeRouting.ts)
- Domain-aware edge routing between related nodes
- Smart path calculation avoiding domain ring intersections
- Relationship type visualization rules
- Edge bundling for related connections
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Cycle Detection System (client/src/utils/graphOps.ts)
- Business domain-specific cycle validation
- Semantic relationship cycle rules by node type
- Dependency chain validation across domains
- Critical path identification in node graphs
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Force-Directed Layout (client/src/utils/d3Relax.ts)
- Custom force parameters based on node domains
- Domain boundary respecting node placement
- Relationship strength modeling based on connection types
- Hierarchical clustering within domains
Importance Score: 75/100

5. Relationship Management (client/src/utils/relationships.ts)
- Domain-specific relationship type validation
- Cross-domain connection rules
- Bidirectional relationship handling
- Connection metadata management
Importance Score: 70/100

Key Domain-Specific Features:
- Business domain-aware node positioning
- Semantic relationship validation
- Cross-domain connection optimization
- Domain boundary preservation
- Hierarchical node clustering

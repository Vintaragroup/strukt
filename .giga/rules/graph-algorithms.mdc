Core Graph Algorithm Components:

1. Domain-Based Layout Engine (85/100)
`client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`
- Radial layout system organizing nodes into business domain sectors
- Dynamic angle calculations for optimal sector spacing
- Node placement optimization within domain boundaries
- Automated radius adjustment based on node density
- Parent-child relationship preservation during layout

2. Relationship Management System (90/100) 
`client/src/utils/relationships.ts`
- Bidirectional relationship tracking between nodes
- Cycle detection for preventing circular dependencies
- Domain-aware edge routing with collision avoidance
- Relationship type validation and enforcement
- Hierarchical relationship preservation

3. Auto-Layout Algorithm (80/100)
`client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts`
- Force-directed layout specialized for domain structures
- Custom node repulsion based on relationship types
- Domain boundary constraints during force simulation
- Incremental layout updates for performance
- Edge crossing minimization for clarity

4. Domain Ring System (75/100)
`client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
- Visual domain separation with configurable rings
- Dynamic ring sizing based on contained nodes
- Drag constraints within domain boundaries
- Domain transition animations
- Hierarchical domain nesting support

5. Graph Operations Engine (70/100)
`client/src/utils/graphOps.ts`
- Domain-specific node grouping operations
- Relationship batch processing system
- Graph state validation rules
- Node type compatibility checking
- Domain membership management

Key Business Rules:
- Nodes must belong to exactly one domain
- Circular dependencies are prevented across all relationship types
- Domain boundaries cannot overlap
- Parent-child relationships must preserve domain hierarchy
- Cross-domain relationships require explicit validation

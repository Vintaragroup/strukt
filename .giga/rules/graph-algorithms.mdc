## Domain Ring Layout System
Importance Score: 90

Core layout algorithm for organizing nodes in concentric rings based on domain separation:
- Implements 5 core business domains: business, product, tech, data-ai, operations  
- Custom radial positioning with domain-specific sector angles
- Dynamic ring radius calculations based on node density
- Domain intersection detection for boundary nodes

File: `client/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`

## Relationship Management
Importance Score: 85

Domain-specific relationship handling:
- Bi-directional dependency tracking between nodes
- Custom validation rules for cross-domain relationships
- Auto-suggestion of related nodes based on domain context
- Specialized relationship types (implements, documents, depends-on)

File: `client/src/utils/relationships.ts`

## Cycle Detection
Importance Score: 80

Custom cycle detection implementation for domain architecture:
- Validates acyclic dependencies across domain boundaries
- Enforces hierarchical relationships within domains
- Detects indirect cyclic dependencies through multiple domains
- Provides domain-aware cycle resolution suggestions

File: `client/src/utils/graphOps.ts`

## Auto-layout Implementation
Importance Score: 85

Specialized layout algorithms for software architecture visualization:
- Domain-aware force-directed layout within rings
- Node clustering by type and relationships
- Edge routing optimized for domain ring visualization
- Automatic spacing based on node importance and connections

File: `client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts`

## Node Type Management
Importance Score: 75

Domain-specific node classification and validation:
- Enforces node type rules per domain
- Manages allowed relationship types between node categories
- Implements domain-specific node styling and indicators
- Handles node type conversion rules

File: `client/src/components/CustomNode.tsx`

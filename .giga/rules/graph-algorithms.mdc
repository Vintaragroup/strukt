### Domain Layout System
**Importance: 95/100**
File: `client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`

- Radial layout algorithm organizes nodes into domain-specific sectors
- Dynamically calculates sector angles based on node density
- Smart node distribution within department boundaries (Tech, Product, Business, Data/AI, Operations)
- Automatic overlap detection and resolution between domains
- Domain hierarchy preservation during layout adjustments

### Relationship Management Engine 
**Importance: 90/100**
File: `client/src/utils/relationships.ts`

- Domain-specific relationship types (depends-on, blocks, implements, documents, tests)
- Critical path analysis for project dependencies
- Circular dependency detection with domain context preservation
- Intelligent relationship suggestion based on node types and proximity
- Relationship validation against domain-specific rules

### Edge Routing System
**Importance: 85/100**
File: `client/src/utils/edgeRouting.ts`

- Smart edge routing around domain boundaries
- Dynamic path recalculation based on node movement
- Bundling of related edges to reduce visual clutter
- Priority-based routing for critical relationships
- Domain-aware collision avoidance

### Auto-Layout Engine
**Importance: 85/100**
File: `client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts`

- Force-directed layout with domain constraints
- Hierarchical positioning based on relationship types
- Domain clustering with configurable attraction/repulsion
- Automatic spacing optimization between related nodes
- Layout preservation during incremental updates

### Graph Operations
**Importance: 80/100**
File: `client/src/utils/graphOps.ts`

- Domain-aware node grouping and ungrouping
- Relationship inheritance during node operations
- Smart node insertion with relationship preservation
- Domain boundary recalculation during graph modifications
- Hierarchical node deletion with relationship cleanup

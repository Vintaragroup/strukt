## Domain Layout Engine (85/100)
Location: client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts
- Radial layout algorithm optimized for business domain visualization
- Multi-ring positioning system with domain-specific angle calculations
- Node clustering by business context (frontend, backend, data/AI, operations)
- Smart overlap prevention with domain boundary respect
- Dynamic radius adjustment based on node density

## Relationship Management (80/100) 
Location: client/src/utils/relationships.ts
- Domain-specific relationship validation (depends-on, implements, documents)
- Cycle detection with business context preservation
- Critical path analysis for project dependencies
- Custom validation rules for cross-domain relationships
- Relationship suggestion engine with domain awareness

## Graph Operations Core (75/100)
Location: client/src/utils/graphOps.ts
- Business domain partitioning algorithms
- Node hierarchy enforcement with domain constraints
- Custom traversal patterns respecting business boundaries
- Domain-aware node grouping and ungrouping operations

## Auto-Layout System (70/100)
Location: client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts
- Force-directed layout with business domain weights
- Smart node distribution based on relationship types
- Domain cluster preservation during layout
- Dynamic spacing rules based on node importance

## Edge Routing (65/100)
Location: client/src/utils/edgeRouting.ts
- Business context-aware path finding
- Domain boundary-respecting edge placement
- Relationship type-specific routing rules
- Smart bundling for related domain connections

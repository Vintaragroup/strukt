description: Provides guidance for implementing domain-specific graph algorithms, node layout systems, and relationship mapping

# graph-algorithms

Core graph algorithm implementations center around three main systems:

1. Domain Ring Layout System (85/100)
`/src/utils/domainLayout.ts`
- Radial layout algorithm organizing nodes into domain-specific rings
- Business domains mapped to concentric circles (inner to outer):
  - Business Core
  - Product Layer
  - Technical Implementation
  - Data/AI Services 
  - Operations Support
- Angular node distribution based on department grouping
- Dynamic radius calculation based on node density

2. Relationship Management (80/100) 
`/src/utils/relationships.ts`
- Domain-specific edge routing with relationship types:
  - depends_on: Technical dependencies
  - implements: Feature implementation
  - blocks: Blocking dependencies
  - informs: Information flow
- Cycle detection for dependency validation
- Relationship path analysis for impact assessment
- Bi-directional constraint validation

3. Auto-Layout Engine (75/100)
`/src/utils/autoLayout.ts`
- Force-directed placement within domain rings
- Node repulsion within same domain level
- Attraction forces based on relationship types
- Collision detection and resolution
- Domain boundary enforcement

Ring Visualization Component (70/100)
`/src/components/DomainRings.tsx`
- Visual representation of domain ring system
- Interactive domain boundary adjustment
- Gradient rendering for domain separation
- Domain transition animations

Collision Management (65/100)
`/src/utils/collision.ts`
- Node overlap prevention within domains
- Edge crossing minimization
- Boundary collision handling
- Space optimization between related nodes

## Domain Layout System
**Importance Score: 95**
- Specialized radial layout algorithm organizing nodes by business domains
- Smart domain sector calculations for Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations
- Dynamic radius scaling based on node density per domain
- Automatic department inference and positioning within domains
- Collision detection with domain-aware spacing rules
File: client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts

## Node Relationship Management  
**Importance Score: 90**
- Domain-specific relationship types (depends-on, implements, documents, tests)
- Critical path analysis for technical dependencies
- Circular dependency detection with domain context awareness
- Cross-domain relationship validation rules
- Relationship suggestion engine based on node types
File: client/src/utils/relationships.ts

## Auto-Layout Engine
**Importance Score: 85**
- Force-directed layout with domain constraints
- Smart node grouping based on relationship density
- Domain boundary preservation during layout
- Hierarchical layout for parent-child relationships
File: client/src/utils/autoLayout.ts

## Cycle Detection
**Importance Score: 80**
- Domain-aware cycle detection algorithm
- Dependency chain validation across domains
- Critical path identification with domain context
- Cycle prevention with relationship type rules
File: client/src/utils/graphOps.ts

## Collision Prevention
**Importance Score: 75**
- Domain-specific spacing rules
- Dynamic collision box calculation
- Smart node repositioning within domain constraints
- Overlap resolution preserving domain hierarchy
File: client/src/utils/collision.ts

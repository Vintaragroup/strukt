## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements an AI-enhanced knowledge graph platform with specialized domain visualization capabilities. Core functionality is organized into three main areas:

## Domain Visualization Engine
- Graph-based domain modeling with specialized node types for architecture, requirements, and documentation
- Dynamic domain ring visualization system showing business/product/tech boundaries
- Custom edge routing with domain-aware path calculation
- Node hierarchy management with smart expansion/collapse

Importance Score: 85

## AI Content Generation Pipeline 
- Multi-stage content generation with domain-specific templates
- Context-aware question generation for node enrichment
- Knowledge base integration for architectural patterns
- Template matching with multi-factor scoring system
- Domain-specific response validation

Importance Score: 90

## Graph Analysis System
- Business relationship modeling with domain-specific connection types
- Documentation freshness evaluation system
- Complex workspace health scoring algorithm
- Critical path analysis for business dependencies
- Relationship strength calculations

Importance Score: 80

## Integration Points

### Template Processing
- Vector embedding generation for PRD templates
- Domain-specific categorization and tag extraction
- Technology profile detection
- API guidance parsing
- Complexity analysis for effort estimation

Importance Score: 85

### Workspace Management
- Immutable snapshot system
- Version hierarchy tracking
- Generation event history
- Context-aware suggestion system
- Foundation knowledge injection

Importance Score: 75

The core business value centers on specialized knowledge graph management with strong domain separation, AI-assisted content generation, and intelligent relationship analysis focused on architecture documentation.

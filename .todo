TODO:
- Verify auto-layout first-load behaviour keeps "create first node" overlay centered on refresh.
- Gather feedback on new modal styling polish in `AddNodeModal` and adjust spacing if needed.
- Run targeted regression around bulk editors to ensure new data guards handle mixed node payloads.
- Map upcoming Strukt Node Flow upgrade steps (suggestion panels, feedback UI) onto the new AI types.
- Verify the new AI endpoints work with `VITE_MOCK_AI_SUGGESTIONS=false` in local/dev environments and document rollout steps.
- Extend `applySuggestions` to deduplicate labels and honor backend-provided edges once available.
- Persist a dismissal flag so the Start Wizard can stay hidden for users who skip AI onboarding on empty canvases.
- Replace ad-hoc buttons in `StartWizard` with shared UI kit variants during the styling pass.
- Align `SuggestionPanel` buttons/spacing with the design system once shared components are available.
- Support process-view contexts when applying AI suggestions so layout choices respect the current view mode.
- After feedback submissions, surface a lightweight confirmation indicator on the node or suggestion panel for collaborative insight.
- Review the dual wizard flows (welcome modal vs overlay) and decide if auto-open of the full-screen wizard is still needed.
- Add persistence or state syncing so the toolbar-triggered wizard remembers the last idea when reopened.
- Load the real workspace ID from the workspace API on boot instead of relying on the default placeholder.
- Capture AI rationales in the wizard session history and consider surfacing them to the UI for transparency.

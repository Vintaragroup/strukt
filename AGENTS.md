## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Visual Architecture Mapping System
Importance Score: 85/100

Core Business Components:

1. Domain Layout Engine (client/src/utils/domainLayout.ts)
- Ring-based domain organization with 5 primary sectors
- Business, Product, Tech, Data/AI, Operations domain mapping
- Hierarchical node placement with domain constraints
- Dynamic sector allocation based on node relationships

2. AI Enrichment System (client/src/utils/enrich/MockAIGenerator.ts)
- Domain-specific content generation
- Context-aware node suggestion pipeline
- Specialized question banks per domain type
- Template-based architecture recommendations

3. Relationship Management (client/src/utils/relationships.ts)
- Business relationship types (depends-on, blocks, implements)  
- Critical path detection in dependency chains
- Circular dependency prevention
- Context-aware relationship suggestions

4. PRD Template Engine (server/src/services/PRDRetrievalService.ts)
- Intelligent template matching using domain context
- Multi-factor relevance scoring system
- Industry-specific template customization
- Domain pattern recognition

5. Workspace Graph Controller (client/src/store/useWorkspaceStore.ts)
- Single-root enforcement with domain validation
- History management with 50-state limit
- Node categorization by business domain
- Relationship integrity monitoring

Key Integration Points:
- AI suggestion pipeline feeds domain layout engine
- Template engine provides domain-specific starting points
- Relationship management enforces domain hierarchy rules
- Graph controller maintains overall domain integrity

The system implements a unique approach to software architecture visualization by combining AI-assisted suggestions with strict domain modeling and relationship constraints.

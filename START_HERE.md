## 🔄 How It Works (The Simple Version)

```
BEFORE:
  You: "Create a node"
  Me: [might skip rules]
  Result: 🚨 Rings break

AFTER:
  You: "Create a node"
  Me: [automatically checks .giga/rules/NODE_SYSTEM_RULES.md]
      [answers The Three Questions]
      [cites NODE_RULES_MASTER_DOCUMENT.md]
      [delivers full validation]
  You: [verify using quick checklist]
  Result: ✅ Rules always followed
```

---

## ✅ Automatic Features

**I automatically:**
- ✅ Check `.giga/rules/NODE_SYSTEM_RULES.md` on node system requests
- ✅ Answer The Three Questions (Rules? Validations? Process?)
- ✅ Reference `NODE_RULES_MASTER_DOCUMENT.md` by section name
- ✅ Use standardized response format
- ✅ Include 20+ item validation checklist
- ✅ Provide specific testing steps
- ✅ Catch red flags immediately
- ✅ Never skip validation

**You manually:**
- ✅ Verify using quick checklist
- ✅ Pin reminder for constant reference
- ✅ Remind me with one phrase if I miss something

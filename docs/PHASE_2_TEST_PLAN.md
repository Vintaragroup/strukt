## Part 6: Known Limitations & Future Testing

### Known Limitations

1. **Heuristic AI**: Current implementation uses keyword-based generation
   - Future: Integrate real OpenAI API for ML-based generation
   - Current fallback: Works, but simpler output

2. **Single-workspace mode**: Can't save multiple workspaces to DB yet
   - Future: Workspace persistence via MongoDB
   - Current: Works in memory during session

3. **No authentication**: Optional authentication implemented
   - Future: JWT-based auth for multi-user
   - Current: Single-user dev mode

### Future Testing

- Load testing (1000+ concurrent users)
- Stress testing (large workspaces: 1000+ nodes)
- Soak testing (continuous operation 24h+)
- Security testing (OWASP top 10)
- Penetration testing (API endpoints)

---

## Part 7: Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Environment
Node.js 24+
Docker & Docker Compose
MongoDB 7.0
Chrome/Firefox/Safari

# Installation
cd Strukt
npm install (both client & server)
docker-compose up
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run validator tests
cd client && npm test -- workspaceValidator

# Run error handler tests
cd client && npm test -- errorHandler

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

```
Before each test session:
□ Kill backend if needed: docker-compose stop server
□ Clear browser cache: DevTools → Clear Site Data
□ Check MongoDB running: docker ps | grep mongo
□ Verify frontend loads: http://localhost:5174

During testing:
□ Open DevTools (F12)
□ Watch Network tab
□ Monitor Console for errors
□ Check performance in Lighthouse

After testing:
□ Verify no console errors
□ Check browser memory (DevTools → Performance)
□ Save screenshots of any issues
□ Collect Network tab HAR file
```

## Part 8: Regression Testing

### Critical Path (Must Pass)

1. **Modal opens** and closes without errors
2. **Generate workspace** returns valid structure
3. **Results panel** displays correctly
4. **Accept to canvas** adds nodes
5. **Error handling** shows friendly messages
6. **Performance** acceptable (< 500ms)

### Regression Test Checklist

```
Before each release:
□ Run all 29 automated tests (100% must pass)
□ Execute critical path scenarios (8 steps above)
□ Verify no console errors
□ Check performance (build < 1s, API < 500ms)
□ Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
□ Verify mobile responsiveness
□ Check dark mode
□ Verify accessibility (keyboard, screen reader)
```

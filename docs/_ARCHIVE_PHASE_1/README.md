# ARCHIVED: Phase 1 Documentation

⚠️ **OBSOLETE - Do not implement features based on these documents**

## Purpose

These documents are from Phase 1 development (initial foundation building). They represent early development and design decisions that have since been superseded.

## Current Authority

For current, authoritative documentation see: `../_AUTHORITATIVE/`

## What Changed

- Phase 1 focused on foundation setup
- Since then: Ring hierarchy has been locked, node placement rules enforced, auto-create designed
- Current system has constraints not in these old docs

## If You Need Historical Context

- Read these for understanding how we got here
- But DO NOT implement based on these rules
- Always check `_AUTHORITATIVE/` for current rules

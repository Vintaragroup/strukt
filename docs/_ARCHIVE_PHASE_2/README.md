# ARCHIVED: Phase 2 Documentation

⚠️ **OBSOLETE - Do not implement features based on these documents**

## Purpose

These documents are from Phase 2 development (framework build and integration). They represent architectural decisions and task completions from Phase 2.

## Current Authority

For current, authoritative documentation see: `../_AUTHORITATIVE/`

## What Changed

- Phase 2 focused on framework setup and foundational features
- Since then: Architecture has been refined, constraints locked in, new auto-create system designed
- Current system enforces rules that supersede Phase 2 docs

## If You Need Historical Context

- Read these for understanding the framework setup
- But DO NOT implement features based on these rules
- Always check `_AUTHORITATIVE/` for current rules

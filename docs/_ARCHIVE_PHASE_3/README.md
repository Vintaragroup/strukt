# ARCHIVED: Phase 3 Early Documentation

⚠️ **OBSOLETE - Do not implement features based on these documents**

## Purpose

These documents are from early Phase 3 development (before current rules were locked). They represent work-in-progress designs and status snapshots from Phase 3 development.

## Current Authority

For current, authoritative documentation see: `../_AUTHORITATIVE/`

## What Changed

- Early Phase 3 had incomplete specifications
- Ring hierarchy rules have been locked and verified
- Node placement constraints are now enforced
- Auto-create system redesigned with smart deduplication
- Many old workarounds and fixes are now baked into code

## If You Need Historical Context

- Read these for understanding previous approaches
- But DO NOT implement based on these rules
- Always check `_AUTHORITATIVE/` for current locked-in rules

## Important Notes

- Old ring hierarchy fixes: No longer needed (now in code)
- Old classification fixes: No longer needed (now in code)
- Old status snapshots: For reference only
- Task completions: May contain outdated feature descriptions

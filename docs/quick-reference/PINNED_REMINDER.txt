## ✅ Quick Validation (Copy & Paste)

Before asking me to implement node system changes, verify:

```
File being modified: _______________
Type of change: ☐ New  ☐ Bug Fix  ☐ Feature  ☐ Refactor

QUICK CHECKS (all must be YES):
☐ I read docs/rules/NODE_RULES_MASTER_DOCUMENT.md section [X]
☐ I understand the 5 Core Rules
☐ I know which rule(s) this change touches
☐ I know which validation check(s) must pass
☐ I can identify which Process applies
☐ I'm using .giga/rules/NODE_SYSTEM_RULES.md to validate

READY TO ASK COPILOT: ☐ YES
```

## 🤖 Perfect Copilot Prompt Template

Copy this template and fill in the blanks:

```
@copilot I need to [describe change] in [filename]

Validate against docs/rules/NODE_RULES_MASTER_DOCUMENT.md:
- Rules affected: [Rule 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 or "unclear, analyze"]
- Validations needed: [Check 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 or "all"]
- Process to follow: [Process 1 / 2 / 3 / 4]

Show me:
1. The Three Questions answered
2. Full code with 5-line context
3. Validation checklist (20 items)
4. Testing steps
5. Expected console output

Then: ☐ Show analysis FIRST  ☐ Show AND implement
```

## 🚨 Red Flags (Stop Me Immediately!)

If I ever do these, tell me to review .giga/rules/NODE_SYSTEM_RULES.md:

```
🚩 Don't cite docs/rules/NODE_RULES_MASTER_DOCUMENT.md
🚩 Don't answer The Three Questions
🚩 Don't show validation checklist
🚩 Don't explain which rule applies
🚩 Don't use standard response format
🚩 Create feature node on R1
🚩 Skip validation checks
🚩 Hard-code ring values
🚩 Default to center parent for features
🚩 Skip R2 intermediates
```

**Response to red flags:**
"@copilot You're missing .giga/rules/NODE_SYSTEM_RULES.md review. Reset and start over."

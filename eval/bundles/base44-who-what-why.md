# Workspace: Product Brief — Lightweight Research Repository

The team wants a simple internal app to collect, tag, and search research notes across customer interviews, product feedback, and experiments. They want quick capture, smart tags, and a clean read view.

Constraints:
- Start with a minimal feature set; expand later in layers
- Emphasize user flow clarity over technical implementation detail
- Tone should be plain language, delivery-focused

# React Frontend Application PRD

## Overview
A modern web application built with React (Vite) providing responsive, interactive user interface with state management.

## Problem Statement
Users need a fast, accessible web interface to interact with backend services and view real-time data.

## Objectives
- Deliver responsive UI across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Ensure sub-500ms initial load time
- Provide accessible experience (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Support offline-first architecture
- Enable team collaboration features

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- React component library (reusable components)
- Client-side routing (React Router)
- State management (Zustand/Redux)
- API client with error handling
- Form validation and UX
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend implementation
- Browser extensions
- Native app wrappers (coming later)

## Technical Overview
- **Framework:** React 18+
- **Build Tool:** Vite 5+
- **State Management:** Zustand or Redux
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- **Routing:** React Router v6+
- **API Client:** Axios with interceptors
- **Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library

## Functional Requirements
1. User Interface
   - Dashboard/home screen
   - Navigation menu or sidebar
   - Form inputs with validation
   - Modal dialogs for confirmations
   - Toast notifications

2. Data Display
   - List views with pagination
   - Data tables with sorting/filtering
   - Charts/graphs for analytics
   - Search functionality

3. State Management
   - User authentication state
   - Application settings
   - Cached API responses
   - Undo/redo history

4. Performance
   - Code splitting by route
   - Lazy loading of components
   - Image optimization
   - Minified bundle < 300KB gzipped

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Browser Support:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile:** iOS Safari 12+, Chrome Mobile
- **SEO:** Proper meta tags, structured data

## Dependencies
- React 18+
- React Router 6+
- Axios
- TypeScript 5+
- Vite 5+

## Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Bundle size bloat | Medium | Implement code splitting, tree-shaking |
| State management complexity | Medium | Use clear patterns, documentation |
| Performance on slow networks | High | Progressive enhancement, lazy loading |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All UI screens functional
- [ ] Mobile responsive (320px - 2560px)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified
- [ ] Bundle < 300KB gzipped
- [ ] 90%+ component test coverage
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] All user flows documented

## Implementation Notes
- Use component composition over inheritance
- Keep containers separated from presentational components
- Implement error boundaries for React errors
- Add analytics tracking
- Document component API with Storybook

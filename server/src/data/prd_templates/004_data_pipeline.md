# Data Pipeline & ETL PRD

## Overview
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for ingesting, processing, and storing data from multiple sources.

## Problem Statement
Organizations need reliable, scalable data infrastructure to consolidate disparate data sources and enable analytics.

## Objectives
- Ingest 100GB+ daily data volume
- Process with < 1 hour latency (near real-time)
- Ensure data quality and consistency
- Support SQL analytics queries
- Scale horizontally as volume grows

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Data connectors (APIs, databases, files)
- Transformation logic (Spark/Pandas)
- Data warehouse (BigQuery/Redshift/Snowflake)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Data quality checks

**Out of Scope:**
- Machine learning models
- Real-time streaming (initial MVP)
- Advanced data governance

## Technical Overview
- **Orchestration:** Airflow or Prefect
- **Processing:** Apache Spark or Pandas
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL, BigQuery, or Snowflake
- **Connectors:** Python, SQL
- **Monitoring:** Great Expectations, dbt

## Functional Requirements
1. Data Ingestion
   - API connectors
   - Database replication
   - File upload/import
   - Scheduled pulls

2. Transformation
   - Data cleaning
   - Normalization
   - Aggregation
   - Enrichment

3. Loading
   - Upsert/insert logic
   - Schema management
   - Incremental updates

4. Monitoring
   - Pipeline logs
   - Data quality metrics
   - Failure alerts
   - SLA tracking

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability:** 99.9% successful runs
- **Performance:** < 1 hour latency (batch)
- **Scalability:** Handle 10x data growth
- **Observability:** Complete audit trail

## Dependencies
- Apache Airflow or Prefect
- Apache Spark or Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL/Snowflake
- Kubernetes (optional, for scaling)

## Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Data quality issues | High | Implement validation, dbt tests |
| Pipeline failures | High | Retry logic, alerting |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Monitoring, optimization |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All data sources connected
- [ ] Transformations working correctly
- [ ] Data loaded and queryable
- [ ] SLA met 99%+ of time
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts active

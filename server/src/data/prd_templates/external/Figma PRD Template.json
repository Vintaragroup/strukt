      "key": "high_level_approach",
      "content": "*Describe briefly the approach you’re taking to solve this problem. This should be enough for the reader to imagine possible solution directions and get a very rough sense of the scope of this project. (e.g., if “The Problem” was engagement in the design process from non-designers, “The Approach” might be a feed which surfaces work that's relevant to them.)*"

      "title": "**Goals & Success**",
      "key": "goals_success",
      "content": "*What does success look like? What metrics are you intending to move? Explain why these metrics are important if not obvious.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# **Solution Alignment**"

      "title": "**Key Features**",

      "key": "key_flows",
      "content": "*Show some mocks/embeds of the experience. Link to any other documentation as necessary. In general, it’s helpful to organize these around certain user journeys / use cases. Show enough of a clickthrough where people can walk away with a reasonable understanding of how the product works.*\r\n\r\n*Embed example:*\r\n\r\n*https://www.figma.com/file/Buoh8VFfzj1Qil6heQWU0h/Twigma-Checkout-Flow?node-id=0%3A1*\r\n\r\n⭐️ Now you can embed private Figma files, too!"

      "content": "*Keep track of open issues / key decisions here. Sometimes, certain decisions are made that might feel controversial; document these here so people know that the discussions have happened and there’s strong awareness of the tradeoffs.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# **Launch Readiness**"

      "key": "launch_checklist",
      "content": "*Make sure you answer all of the questions below and involve necessary stakeholders.*\r\n\r\n| Area | Question | Answer | Instructions if “Yes” (or unsure) |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| **Support** | Will new learning material be needed (or updates to existing documentation)? Help Center articles? Images/GIFs? YouTube videos? Plugin docs? | Yes | Talk to the Product Education team. |\r\n| **Support** | Will this feature require new support processes, like saved replies, new tags to track feature changes, or training the support team? | No | Talk to the Support team. |\r\n| **Growth & Data** | Have you implemented sufficient tracking in order to measure success, risks and impact on user behavior for the new feature? |  | Involve your data counterpart to make sure feature is well instrumented. |\r\n| **Growth & Data** | Could this impact Growth numbers? (E.g., impact to NUX, UI changes to CTAs.) |  | Let the Growth team know. Consider running this as an A/B if you haven’t already. |\r\n| **Growth & Data** | Are we turning this feature on for everyone immediately (versus a gradual rollout)? |  | Defend in this section why you’re opting for an instant ramp to 100%. |\r\n| **Marketing** | Are we running a Beta for this? |  | Talk to the PMM team. |\r\n| **Marketing** | Do we need an onboarding experience? |  | Talk to the PMM team. |\r\n| **Enterprise** | Will this be available only in certain tiers (Pro or Org)? |  | Make sure the Enterprise team is in the loop and have good reasoning for packaging decisions. Also loop in PMM if sales enablement material is required. |\r\n| **Enterprise** | Is this a new action that should be included in the Activity Logs? |  | Talk to the Enterprise team. |\r\n| **Platform** | Are you introducing new functionality that we’d want to add to our Web or Plugin APIs? |  | General expectation is the feature team builds these capabilities into APIs. Talk to Platform team if you have questions. |\r\n| **Platform** | Could this break any existing integrations (e.g., with Zeplin, JIRA)? |  | Talk to the Platform team. |\r\n| **Platform** | Will this introduce new work on mobile or mobile web? |  | Talk to the Prototyping team. |\r\n| **Security & Privacy** | Are you introducing new data models, or exposing new API endpoints? Changing anything with Authentication, Sign in, Sign up? Data flows to a new vendor or outside Figma prod? |  | Talk with the Security team. |\r\n| **Security & Privacy** | Are we collecting any data that we did not already, or using any data in a manner we did not already use it in? |  | Talk with the Legal team. |\r\n\r\n**View Original Template:** [Figma PRD Template](https://coda.io/@yuhki/figmas-approach-to-product-requirement-docs/prd-name-of-project-1)"

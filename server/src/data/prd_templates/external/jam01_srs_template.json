Do not include details here; reference the relevant sections instead.\n\n### 1.1 Document Purpose\n💬 _Clarifies why this SRS exists, what it contains, and who should use it._\n\n➥ State the purpose of the SRS in 2–4 sentences. Name the primary audiences (e.g., product, engineering, QA, security, compliance, operations) and how they use it across the software lifecycle.\n\n💡 Tips:\n- Emphasize that the SRS defines what the system must do, not how it will do it.\n- Mention related documents (vision/scope, architecture, roadmap, contracts) if relevant.\n\n### 1.2 Product Scope\n💬 _Defines the software product’s purpose, boundaries, and relationship to business goals._\n\n➥ Identify the product by name and version/release. In 3–5 sentences, describe its primary purpose, key capabilities, and intended outcomes. Clearly list inclusions and exclusions when this SRS covers part of a larger system. Focus on the “what” and “why.”\n\n💡 Tips:\n- Connect capabilities to business objectives and reference a separate vision/scope document if relevant.\n- Include a simple diagram if it clarifies boundaries within a larger system.\n\n### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n➥ Help readers understand specialized terms and notation by providing a glossary of domain terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the SRS.\n\n💡 Tips:\n- Include terms that impact interpretation of requirements (e.g., “user,” “tenant,” “near real-time”).\n- Keep entries alphabetized and consistent across the document set.\n\n| Term | Definition                                                                                                                   |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| API  | Application Programming Interface - A set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software     |\n| SRS  | Software Requirements Specification - A document that describes the intended purpose, requirements, and nature of a software |\n| UI   | User Interface - The visual part of computer application through which a user interacts with a software                      |\n\n### 1.4 References\n💬 _Lists external sources that are normative or informative for this SRS._\n\n➥ Cite standards, contracts, policies, interface specs, UX style guides, use-case docs, architectural decisions, or a vision/scope document. For each reference, include title, author/owner, version, date, and location/URL. Indicate whether each reference is normative (binding) or informative (guidance).\n\n💡 Tips:\n- Prefer stable links or repository paths over volatile URLs.\n\n### 1.5 Document Overview\n💬 _Brief guide to the structure of the SRS so readers can quickly find what they need._\n\n➥ Summarize what each major section covers (Product Overview, Requirements, Verification, Appendixes), note any document conventions, and mention how updates and revision history are managed.\n\n💡 Tips:\n- Keep to 3–5 sentences focusing on navigation and conventions."

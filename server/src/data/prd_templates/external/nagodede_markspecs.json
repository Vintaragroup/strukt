      "content": "PlantUml can provide several kinds of diagrams. If you want to generate charts by PlantUml in MarkSpecs, you have to launch PlantUml FTP servers by running the command   \n```\nmarkspecs.exe plantumlserver\n```\nbefore.  \nThe command will launch several instances of the PlantUml servers (number of instances is defined in the application config file, or by the command line interface). Using several instances of PlantUml can save generation time, especially if you have multiple diagrams defined in several markdown files. Numerous instances give room for parallelization, and generation time can be, under some conditions, divided by two or more."

      "content": "### Generalities\nRailRoad-Diagram is used to generate RailRoad Diagrams\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams/raw/gh-pages/images/rr-title.svg?sanitize=true\" width=\"2000\" style=\"max-width:100%;\">\nRailroad diagrams are mostly used to define software language grammar, as you can see on https://www.json.org/json-en.html.But they may be used for other purpose.  \nThe diagrams are generated in SVG format by a Python script created from scracth by Markspecs. The script will refer to the Railroad-diagram Python library (available https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams). The path to the library is set in the configuration file.\n### Prerequisite\nPython > 3.8 (tested configuration, should be OK with any version > 3.1).\n### Installation and Configuration\nBy default, MarkSpecs is provided with the RailRoad-diagrams library provided in the vendor/railroad directory. \nTo update the RailRoad-Diagrams library, your are free to replace the content of the directory by a new version of the library, or you can set the new version in a directory of your choice and update the MarkSpecs configuration file.\n### Syntax\nRefer to https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams to know the syntax.  \nIn the markdown file, you don't have to provide the Diagram object. You only need to provide the list of diagam items, as in the exemple below:\n<pre>\n  ```railroad\n   Optional('+', 'skip'),\n  Choice(0,\n    NonTerminal('name-start char'),\n    NonTerminal('escape')),\n  ZeroOrMore(\n    Choice(0,\n      NonTerminal('name char'),\n      NonTerminal('escape')))\n  ```\n</pre>\nThis exemple will lead MarkSpecs to generate the Python Script\n```python\nimport sys\nimport importlib.util\nspec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(\"railroad\", \"C:/Temp/railroad-diagrams-gh-pages/railroad.py\")\nmodule = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\nsys.modules[spec.name] = module \nspec.loader.exec_module(module)\n        \nfrom railroad import *\nd = Diagram(\n  Optional('+', 'skip'),\n  Choice(0,\n    NonTerminal('name-start char'),\n    NonTerminal('escape')),\n  ZeroOrMore(\n    Choice(0,\n      NonTerminal('name char'),\n      NonTerminal('escape'))))\nd.writeSvg(sys.stdout.write)\n```\n### Licence\n[CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)  \nThis document and all associated files in the github project https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams are licensed under CC0. This means you can reuse, remix, or otherwise appropriate RailRoad-Diagrams project for your own use without restriction.\n### SVG data generation\nThe SVG data are generated through a Python script created on the flag by MarkSpecs. One of the difficulties is to refer to the RailRoad-Diagrams library by providing an absolute path (Python management of the libraries, modules,... has some specificities). Maybe a more efficient solution exists...\n\nA typical python file created on the flag, may look:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport importlib.util\nspec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(\"railroad\", \"C:/Specific_Path/.../railroad/railroad.py\")\nmodule = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\nsys.modules[spec.name] = module \nspec.loader.exec_module(module)\n        \nfrom railroad import *\nd = Diagram(\n  Optional('+', 'skip'),\n  Choice(0,\n    NonTerminal('name-start char'),\n    NonTerminal('escape')),\n  ZeroOrMore(\n    Choice(0,\n      NonTerminal('name char'),\n      NonTerminal('escape'))))\nd.writeSvg(sys.stdout.write)\n```"

      "title": "Schemdraw",
      "key": "schemdraw",
      "content": "### Aim\nSchemDraw is a python package for producing high-quality electrical circuit schematic diagrams.\n### Installation and Configuration\nRequires Python >3.7, numpy and matplotlib\n```\npip install numpy\npip install matplotlib\n```\nSources are available on bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/cdelker/schemdraw/downloads/ but for the project, I add the sources as subtree \n```git\ngit subtree add --prefix=vendors/schemdraw/ git@bitbucket.org:cdelker/schemdraw.git master\n```\nWhen building the project, I zip the subfolder _schemdraw_ and copy it to the vendors output directory. Thanks the zip, it becomes easy to import the Python project by using _zipimport_.  By this way, it's very easy to keep the Markspecs and Schemdraw up to date.  \nFor information, the content of the zipfile follows the schem:\n<pre>\nschemdraw.zip\n  |\n  +-schemdraw (directory)\n    |\n    + __init__.py\n    + schemdraw.py\n    + ...\n    + backends (directory)\n    + dsp (directory)\n    + elements (directory)\n    + (other directoris)\n</pre>\nThis is an intersting approach to provide a way to update easily Schemdraw without impact on MarkSpecs. But you have to remember that Schemdraw request Matplotlib and Numpy.   \nUnfortunately, it also means you have to install the Matplotlib and Numpy libraries on your Python environment to run Schemdraw through Markspecs.  \nI am not a Python expert, so instead of a fight with Python and its libraries (or do other solutions, like making an exe...), I provide the sources of the tools and the user is free to change the way to import the libraries by an update of the _schemdraw-header.txt_ file.  \nThe _schemdraw-header.txt_ file contains the definition of the imports. So, if you want to change the way to import the libraries, your are free to go.  \nThe current definition of the header file is:\n```python\n#Start of header\nimport sys\nimport zipimport\nimporter = zipimport.zipimporter(\"${schemdraw_path_zip}\") \nmod=importer.load_module('schemdraw')\n#End of header\n```\nThe _${schemdraw_path_zip}_ will be replaced by MarkSpecs by the definition provided in the Application configuration file. If you want to change the header file but also want to keep the way to insert the path to the schemdraw zip file, you have to use _${schemdraw_path_zip}_ keyword.\n\n### Syntax\nMarkSpecs simplifies the syntax in regard of the original Schemdraw qyntax. There is no need to refer to the Drawing.Add() to build a schematic.  \nThe MarkSpecs syntax becomes more easy and straighforaward than the original Schemdraw commands as MarkSpecs will complete the description to get the Python commands.\n```\nResistor(d='right', label='1$\\Omega$')\nCapacitor(d='down', label='10$\\mu$F')\nLine(d='left')\nSourceSin(d='up', label='10V')\n```\nIs equivalent to the Python commands\n```python\nd = schemdraw.Drawing()\nd.add(elm.Resistor(d='right', label='1$\\Omega$'))\nd.add(elm.Capacitor(d='down', label='10$\\mu$F'))\nd.add(elm.Line(d='left'))\nd.add(elm.SourceSin(d='up', label='10V'))\n```\nFor general syntax, refer to https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.\n### SVG data generation\nTypicall exemple of use:\n<pre>\n```schemdraw\nResistor(d='right', label='1$\\Omega$')\nCapacitor(d='down', label='10$\\mu$F')\nLine(d='left')\nSourceSin(d='up', label='10V')\n```\n</pre>\nWill lead to the temporary Python file:\n```python\n#Start of header\nimport sys\nimport zipimport\nimporter = zipimport.zipimporter(\"c:/Markspecs/vendors/schemdraw.zip\") \nmod=importer.load_module('schemdraw')\n#End of header\nimport schemdraw\nimport schemdraw.elements as elm\nd = schemdraw.Drawing()\nd.add(elm.Resistor(d='right', label='1$\\Omega$'))\nd.add(elm.Capacitor(d='down', label='10$\\mu$F'))\nd.add(elm.Line(d='left'))\nd.add(elm.SourceSin(d='up', label='10V'))\nd.save(\"c:/Temp/temp.svg\")\n```\n### Licence\n[MIT Licence](https://mit-license.org/)\nCopyright (c) 2014-2020 Collin J.
